# Tech Stack

> Warpzone is running on NextJS 12 and React 18 with concurrency
> features fully enabled. At the current time Chakra UI is not
> compatible with concurrent rendering features so the app will behave
> like a React 17 app. As soon as Chakra UI supports React 18, Warpzone
> will see a huge gain in loading performance.

- Next.js 12
- React 18
- Chakra UI 1.8
